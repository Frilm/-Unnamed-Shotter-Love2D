# Unnamed-Shotter-Love2D
This is my game made on the Love2D. Many thanks for the help [MXRD3R](https://github.com/MXRD3R).
<h1>how to install and play the game</h1>
 First you install love2d no later than versions 11.4, then install the zip file of the source code (I hope you know how to do it :3), then if you haven't done it, make a shortcut to love.exe, and then throw the folder from the archive into the shortcut and the game is running, enjoy your short game ;3
